Sudoku Solver Project
Overview
The Sudoku Solver project is designed to provide users with an engaging and intuitive interface for entering and solving Sudoku puzzles. This project combines robust front-end development for user interaction with powerful back-end algorithms to solve the puzzles efficiently.

Front-End Development
The front-end of the Sudoku Solver project is designed to provide users with an engaging and intuitive interface for entering and solving Sudoku puzzles. Key aspects include:

HTML5 and CSS3: These foundational web technologies are used to structure the content and style the application, ensuring a modern and responsive design.

*JavaScript:* Essential for adding interactivity, JavaScript is used to create a dynamic grid where users can input their Sudoku puzzles.

*Grid Layout:* CSS Grid is employed to create a flexible and responsive layout for the Sudoku grid, ensuring it looks good on all devices.

*Animations:* CSS animations enhance the user experience, providing smooth transitions and visual feedback when interacting with the grid and buttons.

*Fonts and Colors:* Modern fonts and a stylish color palette are chosen to make the interface visually appealing.

*Back-End Development*
The back-end of the Sudoku Solver project is responsible for the core functionality of solving the puzzles. Key aspects include:

*Python:* The primary programming language used for its simplicity and powerful libraries.

*Flask:* A lightweight web framework used to create a RESTful API that handles puzzle submissions and returns solutions.

*Z3 Theorem Prover:* A powerful solver used to implement the algorithm that solves the Sudoku puzzles, ensuring accuracy and efficiency.

*JSON:* Utilized for data exchange between the front-end and back-end, allowing the application to send puzzle data and receive solutions seamlessly.
